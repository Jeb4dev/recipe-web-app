# Recipe Storage Web App
### Written in python using Flask
App contains recipe creation and automated recipe incrediants amount calculation depending of how many person recipe serves.


## Purpose
This project was made as part of the weekly programming challenge hosted by [DevJam].
The project was made for learning purposes.
### What I learned
The project was once againg very interesting and I learned lots of things like using css media print, lots of javascript, and for example using `white-space:no-wrap;`. Project included adding html elements via button clicks and using database relationships.
